# 3D U-Net for Medical Image Segmentation

This project demonstrates the training and evaluation of a 3D U-Net convolutional neural network for segmenting medical images. It includes a full pipeline from loading and preprocessing data to model training, evaluation, and visualization of segmentation results.

## Project Structure

- `model/`: Contains the 3D U-Net model definition.
- `data/`: Scripts for loading and preprocessing data.
- `metrics/`: Implementation of evaluation metrics, including the Dice coefficient.
- `integration/`: Example code for integrating the model with hospital workflows (conceptual).
- `utils/`: Utility functions for visualization and other helper functions.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for interactive model training and evaluation.
- `requirements.txt`: List of libraries required to run the code.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Installation
